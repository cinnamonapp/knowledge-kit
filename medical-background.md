##Why is glucose important for the general population?
“Insulin resistance is the major cause of aging and death in the developed and most of the developing world” [The Blood Sugar Solution](http://www.amazon.com/The-Blood-Sugar-Solution-UltraHealthy/dp/031612737X)

“The killer app is going to be, and I don’t know whether it will be technically possible, if you could get to a continuous glucose monitor that didn’t require you to puncture your skin into a blood vessel. That would be revolutionary. (See [Google X’s effort](http://recode.net/2014/01/16/googles-latest-moon-shot-is-a-smart-contact-lens-for-diabetes-patients/) to create contact lenses that might do just this.)
The fundamental thing that is driving the obesity epidemic is spiking your glucose constantly and bringing in insulin.
So for instance, the average American drinks between 500 and 600 12-ounce sweetened drinks a year. I have none. So that means they’ve spiked their glucose 500 times a year more than I have.
Well, your pancreas has so many shots of insulin per lifetime — that’s not quite true, but essentially. So if you’re using it up gratuitously, before long you end up insulin resistant and then all kinds of bad things happen to you.
[Two-thirds](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/overwt.htm) of the country is overweight or obese. Most of that is lifestyle choices because, in 1970, it wasn’t that way.
So here’s a number. In 1970, the average American consumed one pound a year of high-fructose corn syrup. Today, it’s more than [50 pounds per year](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2012/11/27/global-high-fructose-corn-syrup-use-may-be-fueling-diabetes-increase/) per person.”

##What can high blood glucose cause?
- Cardiovascular disease
- Cancer
- Dementia
- Stroke
- Kidney damage
- Nerve damage

##Sugar is an addiction

![](http://ikillfatforaliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/infographsugaraddiction.jpg)

Yale’s [Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity](http://www.yaleruddcenter.org/) has developed a scale to determine if you have food addiction. It is incredibly interesting and valuable to evaluate behaviors that are typical of people who have problems in controlling their “junk food” intake, therefore this is the focus of an app that wants to have an impact on it.

###A large number of people is addicted to industrial food. 
Examples:
- Sweets like ice cream, chocolate, doughnuts, cookies, cake, candy, ice cream 
- Starches like white bread, rolls, pasta, and rice 
- Salty snacks like chips, pretzels, and crackers 
- Fatty foods like steak, bacon, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, pizza, and French fries 
- Sugary drinks like soda pop 

High sugar/high fat food generates the release of dopamine and works like most other drugs like heorin, morphin. Obese (like drug addicts) have a - partly genetically determined- reduced number of dopamine receptors, therefore they crave for more stimulus.
People develop a tolerance for sugar, therefore they need more and more to be satisfied. Just like drugs, there’s a withdrawal syndrome, and after an initial phase of enjoyment of food, people need a certain amount of sugar to feel normal.
Liquid sugar calories are the most addictive “food” in the diet; they are the single biggest source of added sugar in the diet and they drive diabetes and obesity in a way that solid food (even solid junk food) doesn’t. Many of these drinks are also loaded with caffeine, which compounds their addictive properties.

###Sugar intake in Ages
Let’s see how and why sugar intake in ages has increased so much.

<table>
<tr><td><b>Paleolithic man:</b></td> <td>22 teaspoons/year</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>1800s man:</b></td> <td>10 pounds/year</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Today’s american man:</b></td> <td>150-180 pounds/year</td></tr>
</table>

Most important cause: high fructose corn syrup, contained in industrial food and beverages. 

Measuring: the importance and sensitivity of insulin versus blood sugar

Current standard for diabetes diagnosis are such that diabetes (or prediabetes) is only revealed once damage has already been created to the body.
That’s why it’s so important to create tools that help people understand and manage their glucose intake well before they are diagnosed of suffering any conditions.
This step-by-step guide is written by a patient -Jenny Ruhl- who has had type 2 diabetes for many years and has written the book [Blood Sugar 101](http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14045524.php)

[How to Lower Your Blood Sugar](http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14045524.php)

It is a good source to imagine features and paths our app could give the users.

She also maintains this interesting website:  http://diabetesupdate.blogspot.it/ which is loaded with interesting info and resources, coming from somebody who has dedicated a large part of their life to fighting the results of sugar damages.

Just as a reference, this book on [low carb diets](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Science-Carbohydrate-Living/dp/0983490708/ref=pd_sim_b_11?ie=UTF8&refRID=1Q2ZGEHZTPRHMCGVZ6DR) has excellent reviews and could provide a good source and guide to create a path for our app and recommendations for healthy nutrition.  I haven’t yet read/reviewed it.

This is a very interesting and simple reference on numbers that explains what exactly needs to be measured in order to provide real information, well before diabetes is actually full blown. Pages 10-11-12

##How is diabetes currently diagnosed?
Just as a reference, you will here find the current limitations outlined in the above analysis. Diabetes is a stigma that health insurances want to postpone as much as possible, therefore all that comes before - and the most fertile ground for prevention - is not included in current medical trends.
